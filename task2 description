To tackle this task I have followed the following procedures: 

1 - Meaningful Data:

I have tried to transform the given data to data that can be manipulated. I have done the following:

a - I transformed the alphabets into numbers with this coding strategy:
          [  a  = 10000  , b = 10001 , c = 10002 . . . and so on ]
          
b - I have eliminated any data with NaN values. I am not sure how this elimination can affect the accuracy of the model.


2 - Testing the models:

After uploading the data into python, I tried different models such as: 

K-Nearest Neighbors
Linear Discriminant Analysis
Logistic Regression
Classification and Regression Trees

By calculating the average and the standard diviation of each model, the KNN model was the best fit.


3- Choosing the best parameter: 

Finally, I tried parameter from [1 to 30]. It appeared that 1 is the best fit. 



# I think my procedures are very limited. There are so much to learn.
